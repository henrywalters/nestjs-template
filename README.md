# NestJS Template
NestJS is an awesome NodeTS web framework. This is a template which contains the boilerplate for some, what I believe to be, necessary features in a website. This includes:

- TypeORM with CLI setup
- Dotfile configuration out the gate
- Validation ready to go
- Swagger Documentation
